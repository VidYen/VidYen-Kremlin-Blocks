# VYPS-Russian-Blocks
Fork of the Coinfaucet Blockrain from the WordPress version

This is a stripped down version of the Coinfaucet so that I can have a simple video poker game for VYPS.

To manually install download just the folder and zip it into a WordPress plugins folder.

Requires [VYPS](https://github.com/VidYen/VYPS-Plugin) and at least one point type to work.

Would suggest using it to make money with the miner though unless you like using admin panel to give away points.
